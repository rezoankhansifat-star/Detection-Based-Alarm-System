# Detection-Based-Alarm-System
This project combines Computer Vision and Arduino to create a smart face detection alarm system. Whenever a human face is detected by the laptop or PC webcam, an alarm (buzzer) connected to Arduino is automatically triggered. The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-time interaction between software (computer vision) and hardware (Arduino).
